# Marlin-for-GB2-V3.52-baseline-detached-from-master
This is the baseline we have been using for all Gigabots out the door of our Houston assembly facility. Supports our heated bed, Viki LCD remote, SD card support, and current entstop configuration. Some forking will occur here to support other features, but work is progressing on re-forking from Marlin's master repo. Stay tuned!
